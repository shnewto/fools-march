Cave is at the edge of a marsh?

cave entrance, "guarded" by two bickering goblins. they don't want to be out here, the want to see what happens!!
"its your fault we're out here!"

if they see the group coming, they run inside. if they are surprised they will fight and maybe try to run inside.

walking into the cave, it's narrow, dark, and damp. but it soon opens up into a large cavern lit dimly by a fire at the far end. where there are 4 goblins (if they killed the ones outside, there are four here. if the ones outside ran in, there were only two inside so now there are 4, etc.)

these goblins know something is wrong. the boss keeps pulling goblins away and they don't come back... I don't wanna go next, you have to..


after the goblins, there is a fork in the path. the right leads to a dead end, three crates lie in broken pieces, rummaged through. there are some wooden bowls and clay vases. (maybe worth 3 GP if sold.)

the left leads to the portal room. those strange fish are phasing through the walls here...

There is a sort of tripod, with a broken brass clock wound around a shard of splintering stone. the stone is chameleon when you look at it. and it's temperature is like cold sweat, hot and cold at the same wierd time. (fragment of limbo)

if sneaky, they catch the "druid" mumbling what seems like drooling nonsense to a portal that looks like a void, like space was just erased from the spot you look at. (the driud is high as fuck). 

Otherwise, they jump straigt into combat. 

Once the druid dies,a goblin falls through the portal, screaming in pain. they wretch on the floor for a brief moment, then a slimy gray green tadpole bursts from its chest. they enter combat with it. 

once combat's over, there's still the portal. 
- if the adventurers destroy / disassemble the tripod, the portal closes
- if the adventurers walk through the portal, they end up in limbo and the portal closes behind them...
- if they leave it, we don't know what will come from it...
