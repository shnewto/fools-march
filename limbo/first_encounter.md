Through the portal:

- once through, all are through. if one character goes, reality bends and errodes, erases around them. 

- then, they're all in a "different" place. something familiar for a flicker. 

- THEN. they see the roiling chaos. Red and neon purple sky. metallic rain falls sparsely, shiny and wet like mercury. 

- a pile of goblin bodies looks like most of the parts of something like 12-15 goblins. 

- red slaad, dead. bright apple red skin with grass green spots frekeled on it's face, shoulders and arms. Its hands have long curving claws that look hollow and sharp. it has a wet swampy smell. it's skull has been cacked open and there's the glint from its wet bloody brain. it's a red and gold stone, the size of a child's fist. if they take it, it doesn't seem to do anything though...

- there are gaps in the earth beneath them that open to show endless space. 
- not far ahead, the ground stops and it's sheer nothing but neon lighting below. 
- in the distance are jagged bodies of Iron and ice, colliding in a burst of steam and lightning. 
- An island that looks like a floating forest, tree's roots dangling moves past, was there music comig from it..??


- then, an amorphous mass of fire, glininting steel, ice and fog rises. from below the cliff edge. toxic looking green fog rises from the dead bodies, it's almost like they fogs have faces, (souls of the goblins and slaad) and are stream into the mass. 

> He...lll...ooooo little mices, little monsters. What brings you here.... I'm glad to see you, I am. I hope you like my home, YOU SHOULD STAY!!! chunks of iron start raining down, forming walls around them. 

- somehow, maybe they reason, maybe the chaos gets bored. 

> No fun, you should go. Or not, you can always just die. If you want to go, here's the door...wait no...I can't remember...you can make your own! just remember it! If you do want to stay and die, I can help!

In the distance, there's the cry of what sounds like a giant hawk. they can see in the distance an figure, snakelike with three sets of wings. it's getting bigger, heading their way. if it arrives, it breaths bursts of lightning. it glints blindlingly. 

it will just kill them if they don't run...?

they have to describe the door they imaigne, then roll...against a dc 17.
