"Deep speech language meetup"

Run by marta the mage. You talk to eachother haltingly and fall back to common. 

there are thumb sized multicolored pastel fish phasing through the ceiling and corner of the wall behind the bar.

do they notice?

there are weird things happening...



Peren at a table alone, scoffs at travelers if given the opportunity. "Fuck off" (in deep speech.)

Loril and Orel, the slackers know who's doing the weird stuff. Their dealer, a weird satyr named Mib. He's willing to do some fucked up stuff but it always gets us high lol. If you see them, tell 'em we want another dose. If you get some we should get fucked upppp. (carousing with loril or orel when there are drugs available.)


osborn and ardryn throwing bones and playing cards. on the way out, to the characters:
ardryn: aye! travellers! nothing more honorable than to die trying!
osborn: haha, except succeding! and not dying ya old shit!
