# population of fire bend

secret info:
these are HIGH level, ex-adevnturers. They've slowly gathered for a life of peace and shun the "responibility" of exteral affairs. they don't need the money they make on general goods / armor / weapons / potions. they're doing it as a cover. 

they are deeply skeptical of the adventurers when they arrive but it's not apparent in all of them. they are generally appathetic. They need to be won over.

- marta domini, always looks like she
- Sutha, at the Howling Pony Tavern: "WOW look at that shiny AXE."
- the slacker teen is just that, not a hero in their own right.
- Aust Liadon,at the general store: patronizing
- Orianna at the bookstore: talks down, like they're children.

(note: vall, the drow child. when addressed: you will call me magesty! I am your lord, rightful king of the nine hells! he's up to actual trouble but the townsfolk have it 100% under control, they're gd badasses every one.)


TODO:
- Skill test for slackers party. hallucinogenic trip to limbo...
- Stats of one (sub any) fire bend NPC in case anyone gets fighty.
- 

why is the town reaching out to these heros?
- there's some weird stuff going on and no-one really wants to get involved...
- marta's is pissed at Bor Amblecrown, and wants to see if there's anyone else interesting out there. potenital new friends / partners...
- 


not a given that the adventurers will fight the sentient choas elemental. they may help usher in madness by helping them. (that'd be craaaazy and prob fun.)
but. if that's the case, the townfolk may end up being a "last batle". the true heros to stop them...
